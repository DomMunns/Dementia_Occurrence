plan for R:

Compare mmse, CDR and group between patients of different genders and SES

Intro -> talk about what the project is focussed on doing ^, speak about how the data was obtained and what each value means especially CDR and SES.
Data import -> talk about how I read the data in and collated it into 1 single file
Data tidying -> talk about deleting rows with missing data and using janitor
Data visualisation -> create figures comparing the values above, speka about how I created each figure
Conclusions -> how reproducible are the techniques I used? Talk about the trends of the data
Word count -> find a way to do a word count which includes the word count of the READ.me doc
Bibliogrpahy -> Complete bib file and format the bibliography so that it knits correctly - works! complete this as I go along


Need to use training and testing somehow!! - possibly using the mri data??

can I use the word count function? -> look at word count addin notepad doc
