  abstract  = "This guideline is concerned with the identification and
               treatment of, and care for, dementia as defined in the 10th
               edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10)
               (World Health Organization, 1992). Care for people with dementia
               is provided by both health and social care organisations, each
               bringing its own particular perspectives on both the nature of
               the dementia and, more particularly, our response to people with
               dementia. As a result, this guideline has been jointly developed
               for the Social Care Institute for Excellence (SCIE) and the
               National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE),
               and we have drawn on the combined knowledge and evidence base of
               both social and clinical perspectives within the area of
               dementia care. This has presented challenges for guideline
               development in analysing and synthesising the two different
               approaches to `evidence' and the sheer volume of literature
               needing appraisal, and the need to produce `joined up' practice
               guidelines to address the sometimes contrasting perspectives in
               health and social care approaches to dementia care.",
